        I have been actively involved in open-source projects, contributing to meaningful enhancements and gaining 
        valuable experience through collaborative development. I am an active contributor and member of SugarLabs, 
        an open-source organization dedicated to creating educational software and tools for children worldwide. 
        As a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) mentee, I had the opportunity to work closely with experienced mentors and 
        the community, which helped me improve my coding skills, deepen my understanding of best practices, 
        and embrace the collaborative spirit of open-source work. My primary experience lies in building AI application,
        Full Stack Web application and debugging.
