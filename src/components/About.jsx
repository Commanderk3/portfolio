        Hi, I'm Diwangshu Kakoty — a software engineer driven by the goal of creating efficient, 
        scalable, and user-focused solutions that address real-world challenges. 
        Currently a 3rd-year engineering student at SRM University, 
        I combine creativity with technical expertise to design software and tools that make a positive impact on society. 
        To me, coding is more than just a skill—it's a powerful medium for transforming ideas into meaningful, tangible results. 
        I'm constantly exploring new technologies, experimenting with innovative concepts, and bringing them to life through clean, 
        maintainable, and effective code.<br/>
